                Feminism is an interdisciplinary approach to issues of equality and equity based on gender, gender expression, gender identity, sex, and sexuality as understood through social theories and political activism. Historically, feminism has evolved from the critical examination of inequality between the sexes to a more nuanced focus on the social and performative constructions of gender and sexuality.  It seeks to eliminate gender-based discrimination and oppression and promote equal opportunities for all genders. Feminism addresses various issues such as the gender pay gap, reproductive rights, sexual harassment and violence, representation in politics and media, and more. Feminism has become an increasingly important topic in today's society, as we continue to strive towards creating a more equal and just world for all individuals. From the #MeToo movement to the fight for reproductive rights, feminism has played a vital role in addressing the gender-based injustices that still exist in our society.

            <h4 id="forQuote" class="blog-subheader">"... quite  common  in  many  societies  to  take  it  for  granted  that  while  men  will  naturally  work  outside  the  home,  women  could  do  it  if  and  only if they could combine it with various inescap-able and unequally shared household duties"(Sen, n.d, pg.407)</h4>

            <p id="forP">
                The association between women and the kitchen has also been reinforced by the media and popular culture, where women are often depicted as cooking and serving food. This reinforces the idea that cooking and domestic work are "women's work," while other forms of labor and intellectual pursuits are reserved for men. These stereotypes are harmful because they limit women's opportunities and perpetuate gender inequality. When women are seen primarily as caretakers and homemakers, they are less likely to be taken seriously in the workplace or be given opportunities to pursue their own interests and passions. I mean, there's absolutely nothing wrong with woman who choose to be stay at home mom. But the society looks down on stay at home moms who take care of the family. They choose to put their time and effort to family over their career. But when woman starts to stand up for herself, fight against the gender pay gap, the reproductive choice, and sexual harassment and assault. For some people, fighting against crimes like sexual assault committed by men "then women are called man hating" (Weiss, n.d, pg.276).

            <h4 id="forQuote" class="blog-subheader">"To be  a  proper  female,  to  be  feminine,  is  to  be   disempowered." (Weiss, n.d, pg.276)</h4>

            <p id="forP">
                It's also important to know that women are not born just for reproductive purpose. While reproduction is a biological function that some women choose to engage in, it is only one aspect of their lives. Women have the right to pursue education, careers, hobbies, and other interests, just like men do. Coming from a southeast Asian, I know a fact that everyone in my country expect a women to get married, give birth and stay at home to take care of the family. In fact, when I was in high school, one of my dad's friends asked me what grade I was, and I said 12th grade. And until today, I still remember he said "Oh, why are you studying so hard, you're about coming to an age to get married and have children. And you're a girl, just get married and stay at home and take care of the husband, he'll go to work and give you money". Staying at home and husband give you money sounds so perfect, but I know why he said that, because most women in the neighborhood where I grew up, didn't go to school after they finished 9th grade. They dropped out and had kids and chose to be a mom and take care of the family, and their husband is the only one who go to work and give them money every month. Nothing wrong with that, cause everyone has their own choice, who am I to judge them? But just don't expect all women in this world to have the same decision. At the time, I didn't know what is feminism or something like that, but I still feel like people just look at women as "reproductive machines" who are submissive and were born just for man's pleasure. I have dreams for my career, and my own life, and I don't need no man to fulfil my life, and I don't want just to stay at home and listen to my husband all the time. I know this idea is still ingrained in our parent's generation passing to our generation. There was once, I told my parents that I don't think I want to have kids, and they said: "Are you crazy? You're a woman, you have to get married and give birth. Look around, is there anyone doesn't want to have kids like you? They have family they have kids.". And I may make my parents disappointed but I know for sure that I don't want to have kids because I'm not sure I can raise a kid with good parenting, and this is my decision for my own life. It seems to sound selfish, because it is in our culture. But I don't know, I guess I'm going to break this circle, and be a black sheep of this family... because I'm gay and I don't want to have kids, it's a combo of what most Asian households don't like (lol).
