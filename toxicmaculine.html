                Toxic masculinity isn't just about behaving like a man. Instead, it involves the extreme pressure some men may feel to act in a way that is actually harmful. Some researchers have come to agree that toxic masculinity has three core components such as toughness, antifeminity, and power. In many societies, boys and men are expected to be strong, active, aggressive, tough, daring, heterosexual, emotionally inexpressive and dominant. This is enforced by socialisation, media, peers, and a host of other influences. And it plays out in the behaviour of many boys and men. The term “toxic masculinity” points to a particular version of masculinity that is unhealthy for the men and boys who conform to it, and harmful for those around them. One way that toxic masculinity manifests in our society is through the idea that men should always be strong and not show vulnerability. This expectation can prevent men from forming close emotional connections with others, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.

                It is bad because it shapes sexist and patriarchal behaviours, including abusive or violent treatment of women. It contributes to gender inequalities that disadvantage women and privilege men. It prevents men from expressing their emotions, leads to a lack of emotional connection and empathy, which can make it difficult to form healthy relationships. It can also lead to a culture of violence and aggression, which can have negative impacts on society. Lack of respect for boundaries and consent for women's physical and emotional safety by being dominant and aggressive, violent.

He's become famous over the last couple years through offering his male fans advice on self-improvement. He also self-described as misogynist, comparing women to dogs, saying women shouldn't be allowed to drive, and claiming that men have “authority” over their female partners. He's also argued that women should “bear some responsibility” for being raped. He said that when men cheating, go out and have sexual activity it is exercise so cannot call it cheating, but if woman talking to other guy, it is cheating. He has faced controversy for his comments on women and his advice to men, which many have found to be sexist and harmful. The rising of Andrew Tate has a significant impact on social meadia, especially on <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/misogynist-influencer-andrew-tate-has-captured-boys-attention-what-teachers-need-to-know/2023/02">young kids</a> that consumed Tate's content. His content is nothing really new to that sphere of content, but he is every negative and toxic trait a man can have in one. Ego, money obsessed, views women as sex objects with no feelings, agency, or humanity, views men as a resource to exploit for money, and will say anything sexist or stupid to keep his young viewers watching.

                Other example for toxic masculinity is the movie The Mask We Live In, which I had a chance to watch it in this semester. It is a documentary that demonstrates the pressure and expectations of society to young men. From early boyhood, they have to prove to other boys by acting tough. As a man, they can be aggressive, but not sad, they can be pissed off and angry but not crying, and showing emotion is weak, more than that, a man uses violence to solve problem.

                Ian, from the documentary The Mask We Live In had an experienced of masulinity in his childhood. He always hear his grandfather said that he needed to be stronger, faster, bigger, and that he's always tried to prove himself and that made him felt like he wasn't good enough. When he was in middle school, he was being bullied and made fun of. He started to change everything in order to prove his masculinity including cutting his hair off, changing the way he dress, lowering his voice, played more sports and dated a head cheerleader, and started to stay away from anyone who less masculine than him. He had a friend who didn't play sport and was being picked on. And instead of staying by his side and being his friend, Ian decided not to be friend with him anymore, not go to his house all because that friend was kind of less masculine type of boy.
