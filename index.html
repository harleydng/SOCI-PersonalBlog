                <p>Back in 2011, the "Don't Say Gay" bill was first introduced by the Republican State Senator Stacey Campfield in Tennessee. It aimed to ban any discussion of sexuality in schools before the ninth grade. And due to a significant opposition that the bill received, it was defeated in 2012. However, Republican State Senator Joey Hensley brougt it back with a new version in 2017, which required educators to inform parents if their child identifies as LGBTQ+. But as the bill faced criticism for potentially putting LGBTQ+ students at risk of harassment and bullying, and for violating their privacy. It was eventually withdrawn by its sponsor, following public backlash.</p>

                <p>There was once, I told my parents that I don't think I want to have kids, and they said: "Are you crazy? You're a woman, you have to get married and give birth. Look around, is there anyone doesn't want to have kids like you? They have family they have kids."</p>

                <p>
                    Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States. Asian Americans have been subjected to verbal and physical assaults, discrimination, and harassment, which has resulted in fear and anxiety within the community. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment in the United States. Physical appearance plays a significant role in the discrimination faced by Asian Americans.

                  <p>
                    White privilege and white supremacy are complex and controversial topics that have been discussed extensively in recent years. White privilege is a term used to describe the advantages that white people have in society simply because of the color of their skin. These advantages may be subtle, but they are very real and can impact everything from education to job opportunities to interactions with law enforcement.

                <p>Toxic masculinity isn't just about behaving like a man. Instead, it involves the extreme pressure some men may feel to act in a way that is actually harmful. Some researchers have come to agree that toxic masculinity has three core components such as toughness, antifeminity, and power. In many societies, boys and men are expected to be strong, active, aggressive, tough, daring, heterosexual, emotionally inexpressive and dominant. This is enforced by socialisation, media, peers, and a host of other influences. And it plays out in the behaviour of many boys and men. The term “toxic masculinity” points to a particular version of masculinity that is unhealthy for the men and boys who conform to it, and harmful for those around them. One way that toxic masculinity manifests in our society is through the idea that men should always be strong and not show vulnerability. This expectation can prevent men from forming close emotional connections with others, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
