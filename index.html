                <p>Throughout history, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community has faced countless challenges and struggles. However, it is important to recognize their resilience and determination in the face of adversity. By understanding the historical context and the stories of individuals who have paved the way, we can celebrate the progress made in the fight for equality. One such remarkable story is that of "Gay and Undocumented: Coming out Twice," which sheds light on the unique struggles faced by LGBT individuals who are also undocumented. In this blog, we explore the rich history of the LGBT community and highlight the inspiring journey of those who have fought for their rights on multiple fronts.</p>

                <p>There was once, I told my parents that I don't think I want to have kids, and they said: "Are you crazy? You're a woman, you have to get married and give birth. Look around, is there anyone doesn't want to have kids like you? They have family they have kids."</p>

                <p>Back in 2011, the "Don't Say Gay" bill was first introduced by the Republican State Senator Stacey Campfield in Tennessee. It aimed to ban any discussion of sexuality in schools before the ninth grade. And due to a significant opposition that the bill received, it was defeated in 2012. However, Republican State Senator Joey Hensley brougt it back with a new version in 2017, which required educators to inform parents if their child identifies as LGBTQ+. But as the bill faced criticism for potentially putting LGBTQ+ students at risk of harassment and bullying, and for violating their privacy. It was eventually withdrawn by its sponsor, following public backlash.</p>

                <p>Toxic masculinity isn't just about behaving like a man. Instead, it involves the extreme pressure some men may feel to act in a way that is actually harmful. Some researchers have come to agree that toxic masculinity has three core components such as toughness, antifeminity, and power. In many societies, boys and men are expected to be strong, active, aggressive, tough, daring, heterosexual, emotionally inexpressive and dominant. This is enforced by socialisation, media, peers, and a host of other influences. And it plays out in the behaviour of many boys and men. The term “toxic masculinity” points to a particular version of masculinity that is unhealthy for the men and boys who conform to it, and harmful for those around them. One way that toxic masculinity manifests in our society is through the idea that men should always be strong and not show vulnerability. This expectation can prevent men from forming close emotional connections with others, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation.
