                Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States. Asian Americans have been subjected to verbal and physical assaults, discrimination, and harassment, which has resulted in fear and anxiety within the community. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in anti-Asian sentiment in the United States. Physical appearance plays a significant role in the discrimination faced by Asian Americans.

            <p id="forP">    
                According to a report from <a href="https://stopaapihate.org/elder-report-2022/">Stop AAPI Hate</a>, there were 3,800 hate incidents reported against Asian Americans from March 2020 to February 2021. This represents a significant increase from previous years, where only a few hundred incidents were reported annually. The incidents reported include verbal harassment, shunning, physical assault, and online bullying. The pandemic has also led to the politicization of the virus, with some politicians blaming China for the outbreak. This has resulted in the scapegoating of Asian Americans, who are perceived as being linked to China.

            <h4 id="forQuote" class="blog-subheader">"More poignantly, most whites insist that minorities (especially blacks) are the ones responsible for whatever “race problem” we have in this country." (Silva, n.d, Chater 1)</h4>
            
            <p id="forP">
                Many Asian Americans feel fearful and anxious about their safety, especially after Donald Trump, during his time in office, often referred to the COVID-19 virus as the "Chinese virus" or <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-53173436">"kung-flu"</a> perpetuating the idea that the virus was linked to China and by extension, to Asian Americans. At the time, there are so many video about crime against any Asian American all over the internet. For example, <a href="https://abc7ny.com/asian-crime-subway-attack-woman-spit-on-hate/10656728/">an unknown individual approached the 48-year-old victim</a>  and began punching the victim repeatedly. He then yelled, "Go back to China" and bit him on the left hand before fleeing the scene. Another <a href="https://abc7ny.com/asian-attack-assault-unprovoked-hate-crime/10385810/">unprovoked attack</a>  against a person of Asian American

            <h4 id="forQuote" class="blog-subheader">"skin color was rated the most important feature, followed by hair, eyes, nose, mouth, cheeks, eyebrows, forehead, and ears". (Boza, Darity, n.d, pg.95)</h4>

            <p id="forP">
                One of the ways in which Asian Americans have been targeted for hate crimes is based on their physical appearance. This is because many individuals who perpetrate hate crimes against Asian Americans believe in harmful stereotypes that link physical appearance with cultural identity and behavior. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Peril">"yellow peril"</a>  stereotype, which originated in the late 19th century, portrays Asian people as dangerous and untrustworthy. This stereotype has been perpetuated in various ways throughout history, including in media and entertainment, and has contributed to the perception that Asian Americans are a threat to American society. This has fueled anti-Asian sentiments and hate crimes.
