                <!--Introduction-->

            <p id="forP">Back in 2011, the "Don't Say Gay" bill was first introduced by the Republican State Senator Stacey Campfield in Tennessee. It aimed to ban any discussion of sexuality in schools before the ninth grade. And due to a significant opposition that the bill received, it was defeated in 2012. However, Republican State Senator Joey Hensley brougt it back with a new version in 2017, which required educators to inform parents if their child identifies as LGBTQ+. But as the bill faced criticism for potentially putting LGBTQ+ students at risk of harassment and bullying, and for violating their privacy. It was eventually withdrawn by its sponsor, following public backlash. <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/harsher-version-tennessee-dont-say-gay-bill-re-introduced">The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)</a> argues that the bill is discriminatory and could contribute to a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ students, who are already at a higher risk of bullying and mental health issues. The bill could also limit access to crucial information and resources that could help LGBTQ+ students feel supported and safe in their schools.</p>
<br>
            <p id="forP">In addition to Tennessee, the "Don't Say Gay" bill has also been proposed in Florida, raising similar concerns about its potential impact on LGBTQ+ students and the broader community. The "Don't Say Gay" bill in Florida which started in 2022, has the same aim which seeks to prohibit the discussion in schools about sexual orientation and gender identity. <a href="https://www.glaad.org/releases/glaad-and-equality-florida-respond-%E2%80%9Cdon%E2%80%99t-say-gaytrans%E2%80%9D-bill-passing-florida-legislature">GLAAD</a>  stated "The bill passed in the state Senate over bipartisan objection, 22-17; 8 Republican lawmakers, including the leader of one of the largest child welfare organizations in Florida, voted against the bill in the Florida House. It now goes to Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has indicated he will sign it". Other than just ban sexuality related discussion in classroom, but this bill also encourages parents to sue schools if they feel like the school violated the bill.</p>

<br>
            <p id="forP">On March 28, 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the infamous “Don't Say Gay” bill, which made it into a law, and this law took effect on July 1, 2022.</p>

            <div class="blog-img">
                <img src="images/urn-publicid-ap-org-56aee61f075a12663f25990c7b31624dGender_Identity-Florida_74789.webp" alt="blog">
            </div>

            <p id="forP">
                A year following the uproar that came with “Don't Say Gay”, DeSantis is working to expand this law to all grade levels, and is again targeting conversations surrounding gender identity and sexual orientation. The law currently impacts kindergarten to third grade students, but with the new one, it will reach up to 12th grade. This means that students in Florida will not be allowed to talk about and learn about LGBTQ+ topics until they are 18 years old. No more pride flag or events, and LGBTQ+ history no longer taught in classroom. After this become law, classrooms now are an unsafe and discriminate place for every LGBTQ individuals. I don't think this bill could do anything to "protect our child" like they said, it would just make it harder for teachers to create a welcoming space. The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, reports that lawmakers have introduced <a href="https://twitter.com/HRC/status/1506337414519816192?s=20&t=bmjnpvjvqnamsIY3ZygmGg">300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills</a> this year.

            <h3 class="blog-subheader">More Harm than Good?</h3>

            <p id="forP">
                I honestly don't understand why someone's identity has become politicized and debated. The discriminatory anti-LGBTQ legislation like this will be dangerous for mental and physical health of LGBTQ+ individuals. It's not that being gay, trans makes them mentally and physically ill. It is the way that everyone else treats them that makes them mentally and physically ill, especially for young people. A <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2021/?section=Introduction">national survey</a> on LGBTQ youth mental health from The Trevor Project, the world's largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people, found that 42% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide last year. According to <a href="https://eqfl.org/equality-floridas-2022-legislative-slate">Equality Florida</a>, the "Don't Say Gay" bill is a legislation that target the LGBTQ community. This bill also allows health care providers and insurers to refuse to participate in or pay for "any health care services that violate their consciences.". A research scientist at The Trevor Project, Jonah DeChants said "It's crucial to note that Florida's "Don't Say Gay" bill is also a "Don't Say Trans" bill — as it effectively bans classroom instruction on both sexual orientation and gender identity. This is part of a sweeping effort we're seeing from misguided politicians across the country who are using LGBTQ youth, and transgender youth in particular, to try and score political points.". Again, a poll of The Trevor Project shows that <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/new-poll-illustrates-the-impacts-of-social-political-issues-on-lgbtq-youth/">85% of transgender and nonbinary youth and two-thirds of all LGBTQ youth (66%)</a>  say recent debates about restricting the rights of transgender people have negatively impacted their mental health. The Trevor Project's survey also found 75% of LGBTQ youth reported they had experienced discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity at least once in their lifetime and more than half said they experienced this discrimination in the past year.

            <h4 id="forQuote" class="blog-subheader">"We don't care if straight people accept us, we're just going to be who we are" (Jay, 2019, Stonewall Forever)</h4>
            
            <p id="forP">
                Back in 1969 when the Stonewall riot took place, homosexuality was illegal and police raids on gay bars were common. People in LGBTQ community used to hide themselves. But on the night June 28, 1969, it marked the first time that the LGBTQ community fought back against police harassment and discrimination. After years of fighting for their rights to "out", now that some politicians passed some laws to push kids back to the closet by limiting discussions of LGBTQ+ issues in schools, make it hard for trans people access healthcare. Banning such could perpetuate harmful stereotypes and prejudices and could make LGBTQ+ youth feel isolated and marginalized.
            </p>
            
            <p id="forP">
                It's funny how we just living our life, go to school, go to work, fighting for our most basic human rights, everything just seems so fine, and then suddenly, some falsely accusations from social media try to label LGBTQ people "grooming", and now that over 300 anti-LGBTQ bills introduced to target gay and trans youth. I mean, we living our life and then law makers politicized us and tried to take away our human rights. Like we didn't do anything at all. All we do is exist and be who we truly are. Sexuality or gender identity are not something bad to discuss, but passing a law and ban it, apparently just make it look bad. And try to attach "child grooming" to people who are LGBTQ, it's just not acceptable. Being a pedophile is not the same thing as being LGBTQ. Sexuality has nothing to do with personality. In fact, the vast majority of LGBTQ+ individuals are law-abiding and do not engage in this behavior. It is harmful and inaccurate to conflate being LGBTQ with being a pedophile. Since the Don't Say Gay bill passed, I know it is going be a really hard time ahead for LGBTQ community. We have never stop fighting for our rights but right now, it's even more challenging.
