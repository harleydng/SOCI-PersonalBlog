                White privilege and white supremacy are complex and controversial topics that have been discussed extensively in recent years. White privilege is a term used to describe the advantages that white people have in society simply because of the color of their skin. These advantages may be subtle, but they are very real and can impact everything from education to job opportunities to interactions with law enforcement. For example, white people are less likely to be pulled over by the police for a traffic violation, less likely to be searched during a traffic stop, and less likely to be arrested or convicted for a crime. White supremacy, on the other hand, is a belief system that holds that white people are superior to people of other races. This can manifest in a number of ways, from overt acts of violence and hate speech to more subtle forms of discrimination and bias. White supremacy has a long and ugly history in the United States, dating back to slavery and the genocide of Native Americans. These issues have roots that go deep into American society. While not all white people are white supremacists, all white people do benefit from white privilege. According to Peggy McIntosh in her article "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack,"white privilege is like an invisible knapsack of unearned assets that white people carry with them throughout life. McIntosh writes, "I was taught to see racism only in individual acts of meanness, not in invisible systems conferring dominance on my group" (McIntosh, 1989). This means that while white people may not actively discriminate against people of color, they still benefit from systemic advantages. However, white privilege does not imply that white people have not or cannot experience challenges in life; it means that any challenges that a white person has faced or may face is not related to the color of their skin.

            The idea that privilege takes many forms is a crucial aspect of understanding the complexity of systemic oppression. Gina Crosley-Corcoran wrote in her article, "EXPLAINING WHITE PRIVILEGE TO A BROKE WHITE PERSON," that "There are many different types of privilege, not just skin color privilege, that impact the way people can move through the world or are discriminated against" (Crosley-Corcoran, n.d.). This quote emphasizes the idea that privilege is multifaceted and intersectional, and that various forms of privilege can impact an individual's experiences and opportunities in different ways. Economic privilege, for instance, can determine the opportunities and resources available to individuals and impact their ability to move through the world. Similarly, privilege can be influenced by factors such as gender, sexual orientation, and able-bodiedness
